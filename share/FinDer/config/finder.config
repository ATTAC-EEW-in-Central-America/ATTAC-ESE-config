MAG_REGRESSION_THRESH 5.5                   # <double> value below which regression may be carried out, above the threshold the original rupture-based FinDer magnitude will always be used. Set to a small value (e.g. -1.) to disable regression, or a high value (e.g. 10) to always use regression. Setting this value to ~5.5-6.0 should be appropriate, preferring an amplitude-based magnitude for smaller events and a rupture length based magnitude for finite fault events.
