# Defines the channel code of the preferred stream used by e.g. scautopick and
# scrttv. If no component code is given, the vertical component will be fetched
# from inventory. For that the channel orientation (azimuth, dip) will be used.
# If that approach fails, 'Z' will be appended and used as fallback.
detecStream = SH

# Defines the saturation threshold for the optional saturation check. By
# default the saturation check is disabled but giving a value above 0 will
# enable it. Waveforms that are saturated are not used for amplitude
# calculations.
# This value can either be an absolute value of counts such as "100000" counts
# or a relative value (optionally in percent) with respect to the number of
# effective bits, e.g. "0.8@23" or "80%@23". The first version uses 1**23 * 0.8
# whereas the latter uses 1**23 * 80/100.
# The boolean value "false" explicitly disables the check.
amplitudes.saturationThreshold = false

# Defines if amplitude calculation is enabled. If disabled, this station will
# be skipped for amplitudes and magnitudes.
amplitudes.enable = false
